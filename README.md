# Arabic Sentiment Analysis Web App

This project implements an Arabic sentiment analysis system using a fine-tuned Transformer model.
It classifies Arabic text into **Positive**, **Neutral**, and **Negative** sentiments.

The repository demonstrates an end-to-end NLP pipeline including data preprocessing,
model fine-tuning, and an inference-ready Streamlit application.
